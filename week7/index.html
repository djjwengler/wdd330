      <h3>Questions:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>I’m not yet sure about the value of closures. The function to turn celsius to fahrenheit could be accomplished without using closure. I’ll have to look into that a bit more. (Edit: the end of the chapter gives better details. So I guess now I don’t understand the purpose of closures that don’t call two functions with parameters?)</li>
        <li>What are the differences between currying and closures? I feel like they are very similar.  I guess currying functions are closures with the option to provide all arguments, not just the first? Hmm.</li>
      </ol>
