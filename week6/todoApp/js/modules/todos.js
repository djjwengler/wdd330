// The comments mention the @param {string} key -- where it describes what the key is used for: "The key under which the value is stored under in LS."

// The key is the "lookup" used to save the value - information that you're storing the Todos in Local Storage. It's kindof like the name of a file that you're saving on a hard drive. If you were to save information in "myFile.txt" then the "key" would be "myFile.txt" and the "value" would be the contents that you're saving inside of myFile.txt.

// // in the constructor you should set a variable with the element our todo list will be built in, and the key we will use to read/write from localStorage

//export { create, createReportList };
